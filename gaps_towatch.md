# Gaps & To-Watch (from D1)

- [OPEN] Compute targets (latency/image, VRAM, GPU-hours) → influences §7 and model sizing.
- [OPEN] AOI + temporal window (timestamps, revisit cadence) → finalize §4 and temporal design.
- [OPEN] SSC details (coefficients vs reconstructions; cluster count) → §5.1.
- [OPEN] Temporal deltas (exact formulation, alignment, fusion location) → §5.2–5.3.
- [OPEN] MCDA criteria/weights (AHP/TOPSIS/custom) → §5.5.
- [OPEN] Damage ontology mapping (xBD/xView2 → final labels) → §4.
- [OPEN] Baselines & ablations (U-Net vs SSC+U-Net; ± temporal; S2 only vs +UAV) → §6.
- [OPEN] Ethics/governance (conflict-zone imagery, privacy, licenses) → §9.
- [RESERVED] Geodesic change detection (if added later) — anchor in §5.2 (theory) and §5.3 (integration).

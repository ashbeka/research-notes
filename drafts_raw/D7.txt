1. Abstract
The increasing frequency of natural disasters and urban challenges highlights the need for efficient post-event damage assessment and land-use analysis. This research aims to develop a hybrid classification framework leveraging lightweight subspace methods and deep learning architectures to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery. Focusing on land-use and damage classification, the proposed framework emphasizes computational efficiency and adaptability, enabling its application in resource-constrained environments.
Datasets such as Sentinel-2 and EuroSAT provide a foundation for training and testing the models, while Japan's disaster-prone regions and war-torn areas in other countries offer validation opportunities. The expected outcomes include a scalable model for disaster recovery efforts, insights for urban planners, and a deployable tool to improve disaster resilience. This study bridges the gap between academic research and practical applications, aligning with the needs of post-disaster reconstruction and proactive urban planning globally.

2. Introduction
Context and Motivation
Disasters—both natural and human-induced—pose significant challenges to urban resilience and infrastructure planning. Efficient recovery and reconstruction require rapid and precise insights into land-use patterns and structural damage. For disaster-prone countries like Japan, rebuilding after events such as earthquakes and tsunamis underscores the importance of optimized, data-driven approaches. Similarly, in war-torn regions, where infrastructure is often decimated, the demand for scalable tools to assist in reconstruction is critical.
Problem Statement
Current methods for land-use and damage classification rely heavily on deep learning techniques, which, while accurate, are computationally intensive. These limitations make them less practical in resource-constrained scenarios, such as post-disaster zones or developing regions. There is a pressing need for models that balance computational efficiency and accuracy while remaining adaptable to diverse environments.

Research Gap
Existing solutions often treat damage assessment and land-use analysis as independent tasks. Moreover, many rely on high-end computational setups, limiting their deployment. Few studies integrate classical techniques like subspace methods with modern deep learning frameworks to create lightweight, versatile models.
Proposed Solution
This research proposes a hybrid framework combining subspace and deep learning methods for land-use and damage classification using high-resolution satellite imagery. The approach prioritizes lightweight computation, enabling on-the-ground application in post-disaster scenarios and urban planning efforts.

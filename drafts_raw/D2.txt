“Disaster Resilience: Land-Use Analysis and Damage Classification Using Sparse Subspace Clustering and U-Net (after feedback)
The increasing frequency of natural and man-made disasters necessitates post-event damage assessment and land-use analysis to enhance disaster resilience, especially during reconstruction. Disaster resilience refers to a city's ability to analyze, respond to, and recover from disasters, requiring precise insights into land-use patterns and structural damage for efficient recovery.
Current post-disaster assessment models often rely on Deep Learning to process satellite and aerial images, which, while accurate, demand significant computational resources, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments (Lee et al., 2023).
This research proposes a hybrid framework combining lightweight subspace methods with Deep Learning for land-use and damage assessment using satellite and UAV imagery. Utilizing temporal analysis through subspace representations, the framework aims to track changes over time. The goal is to create a computationally efficient model for resource-constrained environments to process satellite and UAV imagery, with the focus on the latter, which can help deliver rapid, actionable insights -such as resource allocation and recovery priorities- to urban planners and deployable tools for reconstruction efforts, enhancing disaster resilience.
Damage assessment identifies infrastructure damage levels, while land-use analysis provides insights in spatial distribution of resources and human activity. Combining these tasks offers a comprehensive view of affected areas, enabling targeted recovery strategies, optimal resource allocation, and improved urban resilience.
We propose using datasets such as Sentinel-2, xBD, and xView2, with preprocessing steps including noise removal, resolution alignment, and multispectral band merging. Sentinel-2 will classify land-use features (e.g., urban, rural, vegetation) using high-resolution multispectral imagery (Belgiu & Csillik, 2018). The xBD dataset, annotated for damage assessment before and after disasters, is used for training and validating the model to identify and classify building damage (Gupta et al., 2019). xView2, with detailed annotations of building damage levels, enhances the granularity of damage classification. Incorporating temporal analysis through first and second difference subspaces enables tracking damage progression and recovery trends over time. This dynamic data integrates with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to prioritize recovery efforts based on factors such as damage severity, land use, and resource availability. UAV-acquired imagery complements satellite data for localized insights (Xu et al., 2018).
Given that imagery from satellites and UAVs contains an immense amount of different data, we propose employing Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) for dimensionality reduction. It's excellent for reducing the dimensionality of the high-data imagery while preserving key critical structural features. This makes the data more compact and manageable, allowing U-Net to focus on key patterns and perform segmentation more efficiently (Elhamifar et al., 2013). We can perform the SSC’s preprocessing on the UAV, then feed the output into the U-Net model on a server to classify the images pixel-wise, and assess information of damage areas and land-use categories (Ronneberger et al., 2015). Results are represented as geospatial heatmaps, showing damage intensity, land-use categories, and temporal trends. MCDA integrates these outputs to prioritize recovery actions based on spatial and temporal insights, such as identifying zones needing immediate reconstruction or resource allocation. Combining SSC’s efficiency in high-dimensional data preprocessing with U-Net's segmentation precision can offer a promising hybrid to improve computational efficiency in extracting spatial features. The model will be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and Intersection over Union (IoU).
Incorporating real-time data from UAVs and IoT sensors can enhance adaptability, combining localized imagery with ground-level data (Erdelj & Natalizio, 2016). Temporal analysis with subspace methods tracks evolving damage patterns, while MCDA synthesizes these insights to recommend reconstruction priorities and resource allocation strategies. Testing will cover diverse geographic contexts, including Japan’s disaster-prone regions and war-torn areas with decimated infrastructure.
The result is a scalable, deployable framework for government agencies and NGOs to improve disaster resilience and recovery. The results from this study can also be applied to disaster preparedness, infrastructure planning, smart cities, and climate change monitoring.

## Abstract

We propose a hybrid, compute-efficient pipeline that couples a training-light Difference Subspace (DS) change detector with lightweight U-Net segmentation heads for land-use mapping (Sentinel-2) and building damage classification (xBD/xView2), fusing outputs via Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to produce actionable priority maps for disaster response. We extend DS to multi-date analysis (first/second-order temporal change) and optionally incorporate geodesic statistics on the Grassmann manifold.

## 1. Introduction

### Problem
- Disasters require rapid, precise understanding of where damage occurred, its severity, and which land uses are affected.
- Deep models alone are compute-intensive and underuse classical subspace geometry that can yield fast, interpretable change cues.

### Gap
- Pipelines treat change detection as deep-only, missing fast pre-screening.
- Damage and land-use are often modeled separately with limited decision-support fusion.

### Hypothesis
- DS pre-screening + U-Net heads + MCDA yields competitive accuracy with lower compute and better transparency.
- Multi-date DS (including second-order change) improves robustness to seasonal drift and reveals recovery trends.

### Contributions
- **DS-Change head** (projection-energy, cross-residual; optional geodesic principal-angle metrics).
- **Land-use U-Net** (Sentinel-2) and **building-damage U-Net** (xBD/xView2) with DS prior channels.
- **MCDA layer** to synthesize severity, exposure, access, and temporal trend into priority maps.
- **Edge-aware design** (DS on UAV/CPU; quantized U-Net on laptop/edge GPU).

## 2. Related Work (very brief)

- **Damage datasets:** xBD and xView2 provide large-scale pre/post annotations for ordinal building damage.
- **Segmentation:** U-Net is a strong, efficient baseline for pixel-wise remote-sensing tasks.
- **Subspace methods:** SSC and Difference Subspaces capture structure/change with low supervision; second-order DS links to Grassmann geodesics.
- **Sentinel-2:** Multispectral bands (10–60 m) and frequent revisit enable robust land-use mapping.

---

## 3. Data & Study Areas

- **Land-use:** Sentinel-2 L2A (SCL cloud-masked); 256×256 patches; bands: RGB, NIR, red-edge, SWIR (10-band subset).
- **Damage:** xBD/xView2 pre/post pairs; unify damage taxonomy to 4 levels (no, minor, major, destroyed).
- **Optional:** EuroSAT pretraining; UAV clips for locality; DSM/DEM (future extension).

---

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Preprocessing
- Co-registration and radiometric scaling (S2 reflectance); SCL cloud/shadow mask.
- Per-band standardization; patching (256×256) with stride for coverage.
- Temporal stacks: bi-temporal (T1/T2) or multi-date (T1…Tn).

### 4.2 Difference-Subspace (DS) Change Detection

**Bi-temporal DS**
- Compute PCA bases Φ (T1) and Ψ (T2); principal angles via SVD of ΦᵀΨ.
- Construct difference subspace **D** from orthogonal complement of common subspace.
- Per-pixel change:  
  (i) projection-energy ‖Dᵀ(x₂−x₁)‖₂;  
  (ii) cross-residual (illumination-robust).
- Outputs: heatmaps, histograms, principal-angle bar plots (interpretability).

**Multi-date DS**
- Sliding over T1…Tn; first-order DS between consecutive subspaces (temporal velocity).
- Second-order DS using mid/mean subspace (temporal acceleration) to flag surge/recovery.
- Optional: Grassmann geodesic distance as complementary, scale-free change index.

### 4.3 Land-Use Segmentation Head
- Lightweight U-Net; input = S2 bands (+ optional DS prior channel).
- Pretrain on EuroSAT/curated S2; augment with rotations, mild spectral jitter; cloud masks.
- Output: per-pixel classes and confidence; evaluate with mIoU/F1.

### 4.4 Building-Damage Head
- Siamese U-Net (shared encoder on T1/T2) or change-aware U-Net concatenating DS prior.
- Unify xBD/xView2 to 4-level ordinal labels; focal+IoU losses with ordinal smoothing.
- Metrics: mIoU, macro-F1, quadratic-weighted κ (ordinal).

### 4.5 MCDA Priority Layer
- Criteria: damage severity, land-use criticality, exposure, accessibility, temporal trend.
- Weighting: AHP/normalized weights; outputs: priority GeoTIFF + quick-look PNG.

### 4.6 Efficiency & Interpretability
- DNNs process imagery directly (not simulations): land-use segmentation and damage classification.
- DS pre-screening reduces CNN load for UAV/edge triage and lower bandwidth.
- Principal angles and DS vectors explain what changed, aiding trust/QA.

## 5. Experiments & Evaluation

- **Change maps (DS):** AUROC vs. binary change; geodesic vs. projection metrics calibration.
- **Land-use (S2):** mIoU/F1; cross-region tests; with/without DS prior.
- **Damage (xBD/xView2):** mIoU, macro-F1, ordinal κ; with/without DS prior.
- **Baselines:** deep-only (U-Net/UNet++), DS-only (thresholded), ablations (1st vs. 2nd-order DS; priors on/off).
- **Compute:** wall-clock, MACs, peak RAM; DS on CPU/UAV; U-Net on edge GPU/TFLite.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Label mismatch:** maintain mapping table; re-label edge cases.
- **Registration/clouds:** strict masks; optical-flow refinement (HR).
- **Domain shift/seasonality:** multi-date DS acceleration; NDVI/NDWI constraints; light adaptation.
- **False positives in DS:** couple with semantic masks; threshold scheduling.
- **Compute budget:** DS gating; quantized U-Net; crop to ROIs.

- **Weeks 3–6:** land-use U-Net + DS prior; evaluation.  
- **Weeks 7–10:** damage head; ablations.

## Appendix A — Responses to Reviewer/Senpai Notes

**Q: How are DNNs used here?**  
A: We process aerial/satellite pre/post imagery directly for pixel-wise land-use and per-building damage predictions using U-Net-style models.

**Q: Why computational efficiency if servers exist?**  
A: DS enables on-UAV/on-laptop triage and lowers bandwidth; even with servers, end-to-end cost drops by filtering low-change tiles.

**Q: How does DS help U-Net; why interpretability?**  
A: DS encodes directions of actual spectral change (principal-angle geometry), suppresses nuisance, and provides transparent heatmaps/angle bars.

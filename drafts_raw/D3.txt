“Disaster Resilience: Temporal Damage Analysis and Land-Use Classification Using Sparse Subspace Clustering and U-Net (shortened version)
The increasing frequency of natural and man-made disasters necessitates post-event damage assessment and land-use analysis to enhance disaster resilience. Disaster resilience refers to a city's ability to analyze, respond to, and recover from disasters, requiring precise insights into land-use patterns and structural damage for efficient recovery.
Current post-disaster models often rely on Deep Learning to process satellite and UAV imagery. While accurate, these methods demand significant computational resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments (Lee et al., 2023). We propose creating a computationally efficient hybrid framework combining subspace methods and Deep Learning to deliver rapid, actionable insights such as resource allocation and recovery priorities.
Damage assessment identifies infrastructure damage levels, while land-use analysis provides insights into the spatial distribution of resources and human activity. Combining these tasks offers a comprehensive view of affected areas, enabling targeted recovery strategies and improved urban resilience.
We propose using datasets like Sentinel-2, xBD, and xView2, with preprocessing steps including noise removal, resolution alignment, and multispectral band merging. Sentinel-2 classifies land-use features (e.g., urban, rural, vegetation) using high-resolution imagery (Belgiu & Csillik, 2018). The xBD dataset, annotated for pre- and post-disaster damage assessment, trains the model to classify building damage (Gupta et al., 2019), while xView2 enhances classification granularity. Temporal analysis using first and second difference subspaces tracks damage progression and recovery trends. These outputs integrate with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which prioritizes recovery efforts based on factors like damage severity and resource availability. UAV imagery complements satellite data by providing localized, high-resolution insights (Xu et al., 2018).
Given that imagery from satellites and UAVs contains an immense amount of data, we propose employing Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) for reducing the dimensionality of high-data imagery while preserving key critical structure features, making the data compact for U-Net segmentation (Elhamifar et al., 2013). Preprocessed data from SSC is fed into U-Net to classify damage and land-use pixel-wise (Ronneberger et al., 2015). Results are represented as geospatial heatmaps showing damage intensity, land-use categories, and temporal trends. MCDA synthesizes these outputs to recommend reconstruction priorities and resource allocation. Combining SSC’s preprocessing efficiency with U-Net's segmentation precision improves computational efficiency in extracting spatial features. The model will be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and Intersection over Union (IoU).
Incorporating real-time data from UAVs and IoT sensors can enhance adaptability, combining localized imagery with ground-level data (Erdelj & Natalizio, 2016). Temporal analysis tracks evolving damage patterns, while MCDA synthesizes these insights to guide recovery priorities. Testing will cover diverse geographic contexts, including Japan’s disaster-prone regions and war-torn areas with decimated infrastructure.
The result is a scalable, deployable framework for government agencies and NGOs to improve disaster resilience and recovery. The results from this study can also be applied to infrastructure planning, smart cities, and climate change monitoring.

# Master Skeleton (rolling bullets)

- Problem: compute-heavy DL limits field deployment â†’ need fast, deployable triage.
- Objective: joint damage + land-use; temporal deltas; decision-ready outputs.
- Data: Sentinel-2, xBD, xView2, UAV (+ optional IoT); preprocess: noise/resolution/band merge.
- Methods: SSC representation; 1st/2nd difference subspaces; U-Net segmentation; MCDA ranking.
- Experiments: Japan + conflict-affected contexts; metrics: IoU/F1/Prec/Rec (latency TBD).
- Contributions: scalable + deployable; reusable for infra planning, smart cities, climate monitoring.
- Open: compute budget, AOI/time window, MCDA criteria, ontology mapping, ablations.

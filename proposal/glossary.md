# Glossary & Acronyms

**SSC (Sparse Subspace Clustering)** — Unsupervised method modeling data as a union of low-dimensional subspaces; yields compact, structure-aware features.

**U-Net** — Encoder–decoder CNN with skip connections for pixel-wise segmentation.

**MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis)** — Family of methods (e.g., AHP, TOPSIS) for combining multiple criteria into a ranked set of options.

**xBD / xView2** — Large-scale building-damage datasets with pre/post imagery and damage labels.

**Sentinel-2** — Multispectral satellite imagery (13 bands) for land-use/land-cover tasks.

**UAV** — Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; provides high-resolution local imagery.

**IoU / F1 / Precision / Recall** — Standard segmentation metrics.
